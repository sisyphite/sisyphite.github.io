        <h1>China's Economy in 2025: Resilience Amid Global Headwinds</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">As tariffs bite and domestic challenges persist, China's growth hits targets in unexpected ways</p>
        <p class="byline">Feb 16th 2026 | Beijing | 8 min read</p>

    <article>
        <p class="lead">IN A YEAR marked by escalating trade tensions and internal economic pressures, China managed to meet its official GDP growth target of 5% for 2025. But the achievement came in a peculiar fashion, buoyed by a record trade surplus while fixed-asset investment contracted for the first time in decades. This paradox underscores the strengths and vulnerabilities of the world's second-largest economy.</p>

        <h2>The Trade Juggernaut</h2>
        <p>China's export machine roared ahead in 2025, posting a trade surplus of nearly $1.2trn despite punitive tariffs from America and Europe. This was fueled by dominance in green technologies—solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles—where Chinese firms control 60-80% of global supply chains. The country's share of world manufacturing value added now exceeds one-third, allowing it to wield significant influence over global markets.</p>
        
        <p>Donald Trump's policies, ironically, played a role. By imposing tariffs, America inadvertently pushed allies toward Chinese suppliers for critical components, highlighting Beijing's industrial chokeholds. In artificial intelligence, firms like DeepSeek advanced rapidly, circumventing U.S. restrictions and demonstrating China's innovative edge.</p>

        <h2>Investment Slump and Domestic Woes</h2>
        <p>Yet beneath the export boom lies a stark contrast: fixed-asset investment (FAI) shrank for the first time since 1989. Critics point to overcapacity in manufacturing and a collapsing property market, where secondary prices fell over 20% from their peak. Factory-gate prices declined for 38 consecutive months, signaling persistent deflation.</p>
        
        <p>Consumer spending remained anemic, with per-capita services consumption at just 46.1%—far below the U.S.'s 70%. Subsidies for appliances and cars provided a temporary boost in 2025, but analysts warn of a "payback" period in 2026, where replacements slow.</p>

        <h2>Shift to Services and Stimulus</h2>
        <p>In response, Beijing pivoted toward services in late 2025, exemplified by the booming "ice and snow" economy. Ski resorts and winter sports equipment manufacturing are projected to reach 1.5trn yuan ($217bn) by 2030, up from 1trn in 2025. Local governments pledged investments in tourism and consumer sectors, aiming to rebalance from heavy industry.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pharma Innovation:</strong> Chinese drug firms now rival U.S. peers in clinical trials, conducting them faster and attracting Western R&D labs.</li>
            <li><strong>Rare-Earth Leverage:</strong> Export restrictions on critical minerals showcased China's willingness to weaponize dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Research Dominance:</strong> Leading in 66 of 74 key scientific fields, per the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Long-Term Risks</h2>
        <p>Despite these strengths, rigid politics could stifle dynamism. Xi Jinping's emphasis on strategic manufacturing exacerbates overcapacity, while the property slump drags on. The economy's confidence in its model—dismissing external critiques—may blind it to necessary reforms.</p>
        
        <p>As 2026 looms, questions abound: Will trade wars intensify? Can services offset manufacturing woes? China's 2025 performance proved its resilience, but sustainable growth demands bolder domestic stimulus and flexibility.</p>
